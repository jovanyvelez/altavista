"""
Verification script for the interest generation bug fix.

This script verifies that the corrected logic in generador_v3_funcional.py
properly handles the case where apartments have current debt but no moratory debt.

BUG FIXED: Previously, apartments with zero balance that had historical debt
would still generate interest charges. Now, interest is only generated on
debt that is actually overdue (older than 30 days).
